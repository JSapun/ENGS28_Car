# ENGS28_Car
This branch serves to contain the old drivers and operations for controlling the car remotely via Adafruit's free interface: The Internet of Things. In order to use this code, you will need to add your own network SSID (name) and password along with your Adafruit account name and key. Once you have that, you will need to build the car yourself. I have not included the wiring diagram in the repository as it is relatively straightforward with each component. The port definitions are defined throughout the drivers and motor.c file respectively. Once the car is built with the two rear independent motors, you can then go ahead and insert a serial connection from the Arduino Uno to the computer. Once you find the port the Arduino is communicating on, you need to specify this in the makefile. Finally, you are able to run "make" and then "make flash" in the terminal. You can continue to monitor the serial to make sure the Arduino is connected to the internet. From there, go to Adafruit's Dashboard and create a new controller with the color picker. Afterwards, preset the color to: "|||||" and you can begin controlling the car remotely!

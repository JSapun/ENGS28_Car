# ENGS28_Car

This main branch contains the receive and transmit c files respectively for each microchip. The transmitter is the controller, and the receiver is the car. The basic car components include a nrf24l01 transciever, two dc motor, an h-bridge controller, and a voltage regulator. The hand controller will need an accelermeter, a 10k potentiometer, and a nrf24l01 transciever as well. The transciever is what allows these two devices to communicate wirelessly on the 2.4 GHz band. Once the car is built with the two rear independent motors, you can then go ahead and insert a serial connection from the Arduino Uno to the computer. Once you find the port the Arduino is communicating on, you need to specify this and the code file in the makefile. Finally, you are able to run "make" and then "make flash" in the terminal for each chip respectively. You can continue to monitor the serial to make sure the Arduinos are connected and communicating properly.
